Hello! I am a mixed reality engineer working at mcirosoft on the [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) at Microsoft. I also like quickly drawing out my [thoughts](https://www.instagram.com/_artchana/) whenver I can!

Originally from Mumbai, India, I graduated from the [University of Mumbai](https://www.djsce.ac.in/) (class of 2014) with a B.E. in Information Technology and from Carnegie Mellon University, [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) with an MS in [Information Technology - Mobility](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/index.html). As I have gained [valuable](https://intuit.com/) [experience](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/exchange/email) serving in [unique](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) [roles](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), I continue to look for more opportunities to expand my skillset!

I enjoy helping other women pursue a tech career, performing improv, recording my podcast, [Let's Chaat!](https://linktr.ee/letuschaat) (which you should check out!). Overall, I enjoy building products at scale that solve customer problems in unique ways.

If you want to chat, please reach out! For convenience, you can check out my public calendar and set up time with me [here](https://aka.ms/conferencecallwitharchana).
