Hello! I am a Product Manager in the Mixed Reality team working with the [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) at Microsoft. I also like quickly drawing out my [thoughts](https://www.instagram.com/_artchana/) whenver I can!

Originally from Mumbai, India, I graduated from the [University of Mumbai](https://www.djsce.ac.in/) (class of 2014) with a B.E. in Information Technology and from Carnegie Mellon University, [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/) with an MS in [Information Technology - Mobility](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/index.html). 

<!-- As I have gained [valuable](https://intuit.com/) [experience](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/exchange/email) serving in [unique](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) [roles](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), I continue to look for more opportunities to expand my skillset! -->

My day job involves helping build the Mixed Reality [Object Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/object-anchors/) offering. I have worked on other Mixed Reality cloud solutions such as [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spatial-anchors/) and [Azure Remote Rendering](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/remote-rendering/) as a developer. I also have experience with large scale services from my time spent in Office365. My passion lies in building Mixed Reality solutions at scale and working with our Mixed Reality customers to make sure we are building whatâ€™s best for them.

I enjoy helping other women pursue a tech career, performing improv, recording my podcast, [Let's Chaat!](https://linktr.ee/letuschaat) (which you should check out!). Overall, I enjoy building products at scale that solve customer problems in unique ways.
